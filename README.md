# Lasso Regression Demo

-> This project demonstrates **Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization)** and how it performs feature selection by shrinking some coefficients to zero.  
-> It includes a simple implementation using sklearn and visualizations to understand how L1 penalty affects the model.

## Contents:-
-> Lasso Regression using sklearn
-> Understanding L1 penalty and coefficient shrinkage
-> Comparison with Ridge and Linear Regression
-> Plotting coefficients across different alpha values
-> Demonstrating automatic feature selection

## Key Concepts:-
-> Why Lasso reduces the number of active features
-> Difference between L1 and L2 regularization
-> Effect of increasing alpha (λ)

## Libraries Used:-
-> NumPy  
-> Pandas  
-> Matplotlib  
-> Scikit-learn
